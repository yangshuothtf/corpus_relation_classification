23934188_2014.ann,9,"These findings  demonstrate that miR-137 is a crucial regulator of cancer response to doxorubicin treatment, and they identify miR-137 as a highly promising target to reduce CAR-driven doxorubicin resistance."
28214826_2017.ann,9,"Thus, the signaling cascades, positive feedback loop and cooperative interplay between transcription factors-induced the expression of IGFBP1 gene contribute to the overall responses of emodin."
21743489_2012.ann,9,"To confirm  that the sensitizing effect of NAC1 inhibition on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was attributed to suppression of autophagy, we assessed the effects of the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenosine and chloroquine, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting beclin 1 or Atg5 on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin."
